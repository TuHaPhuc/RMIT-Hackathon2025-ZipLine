## üêõ BUGS FIXED (Latest Session)

### Issue #1: Cards Not Displaying
**Problem:** Game board showing empty, cards not rendering  
**Cause:** Z-index stacking context conflict between overlay and containers  
**Fix:** Added `z-index: 10` to `.game-container`, removed `position: relative` from body

### Issue #2: Card Flickering on Hover
**Problem:** Cards nh·∫•p nh√°y when hovering over flipped cards  
**Cause:** `.card-face:hover` transform conflicting with `.card.flipped` transform  
**Fix:** Changed to `.card:not(.flipped):hover { scale(1.03) }`

### Issue #3: Modal Too Dark
**Problem:** Educational popup backdrop qu√° t·ªëi (0.7 opacity)  
**Cause:** User feedback - wanted clearer background visibility  
**Fix:** Changed to `background: transparent`, removed blur effect

### Issue #5: Card Size Too Large
**Problem:** Cards qu√° to cho laptop screen (160px ‚Üí 200px tr∆∞·ªõc ƒë√≥)  
**Cause:** Initial sizing for desktop monitors  
**Fix:** Reduced to max-width 160px, adjusted game-board to 750px
