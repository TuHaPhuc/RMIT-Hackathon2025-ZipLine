# EcoMatch VN - Project Report

## 1. Introduction

**EcoMatch VN** is an educational memory card game designed to raise awareness about plastic pollution in Vietnam. The game combines entertainment with education, challenging players to match causes of plastic pollution with their corresponding solutions while learning critical facts about environmental impact.

### Project Overview
- **Game Type**: Educational Memory Card Game
- **Target Audience**: Students, young adults, and environmentally conscious individuals
- **Platform**: Web-based (HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript)
- **Social Issue**: Plastic Pollution in Vietnam

## 2. Theme Justification: Why Plastic Pollution in Vietnam?

### 2.1 The Scale of the Problem

Vietnam faces a significant plastic pollution crisis:
- **1.8 million tons** of plastic waste generated annually
- Only **27%** recycling rate, leaving 73% to pollute the environment
- **40 billion** plastic bags used per year
- One of the top contributors to ocean plastic waste in Southeast Asia

### 2.2 Environmental Impact

The consequences are severe:
- Marine life: Over 100,000 marine animals die annually from plastic waste globally, with Vietnam's coastal waters heavily affected
- Ecosystem damage: Plastic takes 400-1,000 years to decompose
- Health concerns: Microplastics entering the food chain
- Economic cost: Damage to tourism and fishing industries

### 2.3 Why This Theme Matters

1. **Local Relevance**: Focuses specifically on Vietnam's context
2. **Urgent Action Needed**: Growing problem requiring immediate awareness
3. **Youth Engagement**: Young people are key to driving change
4. **Actionable Solutions**: Game presents practical steps individuals can take

## 3. Game Design & Mechanics
