REFINEMENT AND DEBUGGING PROMPTS FOR ECOMATCH VN
=================================================

These prompts were used during the testing and refinement phase to debug issues, improve user experience, and polish the game.

BUG FIXES:
----------

1. Card Flip Animation Issue:
   Problem: "Cards are not flipping back when they don't match"
   Prompt: "Debug this JavaScript function for card mismatch handling. The cards should flip back after 1 second if they don't match, but they're staying flipped. Here's the current code: [paste handleMismatch function]. Fix the issue with the setTimeout and ensure cards properly reset their flipped state."

2. Multiple Click Prevention:
   Problem: "Users can click multiple cards rapidly causing bugs"
   Prompt: "Add logic to prevent users from clicking more than 2 cards at a time in a card matching game. Also prevent clicking the same card twice or clicking already matched cards. Current flipCard function: [paste code]. Improve it with proper validation."

3. Timer Not Stopping:
   Problem: "Timer continues running after game ends"
   Prompt: "The game timer is not stopping when all pairs are matched. Here's my startTimer and checkGameEnd functions: [paste code]. Fix the bug where the interval is not cleared properly when the game ends."

4. Fact Display Bug:
   Problem: "All matched pairs show the same educational fact"
   Prompt: "Each card pair should display a unique educational fact when matched, but all pairs are showing the same text. Here's my cards array structure: [paste]. Fix the fact assignment so each pair (id 1-8) has its corresponding unique fact text."

5. Responsive Layout Issue:
   Problem: "Card grid breaks on mobile devices"
   Prompt: "The 4x4 card grid is too wide for mobile screens. Cards are 150px each with 15px gap. Write CSS media queries to make it responsive: 2 columns on phones (<480px), 3 columns on tablets (480-768px), 4 columns on desktop (>768px). Also ensure cards scale appropriately."

6. Image Path Errors:
   Problem: "Some card images not loading"
   Prompt: "Some images are showing broken links. The folder structure is: game_app/assets/[images]. HTML file is at game_app/index.html. Fix all image paths in the JavaScript cards array to use correct relative paths. Current paths: [paste]."

PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATIONS:
--------------------------

7. Animation Smoothness:
   Prompt: "The card flip animation is choppy on some devices. Current CSS: [paste]. Optimize it using transform3d, will-change, and hardware acceleration. Make it smooth on both desktop and mobile."

8. Code Minification:
   Prompt: "Suggest ways to optimize my JavaScript code for better performance without using external tools. Focus on reducing redundant code, improving loop efficiency, and minimizing DOM manipulation. Current code: [paste script.js]."

USER EXPERIENCE IMPROVEMENTS:
------------------------------

9. Pop-up Modal Enhancement:
   Prompt: "Make the educational fact pop-up more engaging. Currently it's just an alert(). Create a custom modal with: semi-transparent backdrop, smooth fade-in animation, close button, better typography, fact text with icon. Should match the green/blue color scheme of the game. Provide HTML structure and CSS."

10. Visual Feedback:
    Prompt: "Add visual feedback when cards match successfully. Ideas: green border glow, scale-up animation, confetti effect, or success icon. Also add a shake animation when cards don't match. Provide CSS @keyframes and classes to add to the cards."

11. Sound Effects (Optional):
    Prompt: "Generate a simple JavaScript solution to add sound effects: card flip sound, match success sound, match fail sound, game complete sound. Use Web Audio API or HTML5 Audio. Keep it lightweight since this is a web game. Provide code to generate simple beep sounds programmatically without external audio files."

12. Accessibility Enhancements:
    Prompt: "Improve accessibility of the card matching game. Add: ARIA labels for cards, keyboard navigation (Tab, Enter, Escape), focus indicators, screen reader announcements when cards match, color contrast compliance (WCAG AA). Current HTML: [paste]. Suggest improvements."

DESIGN REFINEMENTS:
-------------------

13. Color Scheme Adjustment:
    Prompt: "The current green (#4CAF50) and blue (#2196F3) color scheme needs refinement for better visual harmony. Suggest a complementary color palette for an environmental education game that feels hopeful but addresses a serious issue. Provide hex codes for: primary, secondary, accent, background, text colors."

14. Typography Improvement:
    Prompt: "Current font is Arial. Suggest a better, web-safe font combination for: headings (impactful), body text (readable), buttons (clear). Should work without external font loading. Provide CSS font-family declarations and size recommendations."

15. Button Styling:
    Prompt: "Improve button design for better UX. Current buttons are basic. Add: hover effects, active states, disabled states, ripple effect on click, better padding and spacing. Match the eco-friendly theme. Provide CSS for primary and secondary button styles."

16. Loading State:
    Prompt: "Add a loading animation while images are being loaded. Create a simple CSS spinner or skeleton screen that appears before the cards are rendered. Should match the game's color scheme and be lightweight (no external libraries)."

CONTENT REFINEMENTS:
--------------------

17. Fact Verification:
    Prompt: "Review these educational facts about plastic pollution in Vietnam for accuracy and update with 2025 data if available: [paste 8 facts]. Ensure statistics are current, sources are credible, and language is appropriate for ages 12+. Suggest improvements."

18. Instructions Clarity:
    Prompt: "Rewrite the game instructions to be clearer and more concise. Current text: [paste]. New version should: explain objective in one sentence, list steps to play (3-4 bullet points), mention what happens when cards match, be friendly and encouraging."

19. About Section Content:
    Prompt: "Write compelling content for the 'About' section that explains: why plastic pollution in Vietnam matters, the purpose of this game, what players will learn, call-to-action for real-world impact. Keep it under 150 words, engaging tone for young audience."

TESTING AND VALIDATION:
-----------------------

20. Cross-Browser Testing:
    Prompt: "What are potential cross-browser compatibility issues with this code: [paste]. Test for: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge. Flag any CSS properties or JavaScript features that might not work in older browsers. Suggest fallbacks."

21. Mobile Touch Events:
    Prompt: "The card flip works with mouse click but might have issues on touch devices. Add proper touch event handling: touchstart, touchend, prevent double-tap zoom. Current click handler: [paste]. Make it work seamlessly on mobile."

22. Error Handling:
    Prompt: "Add robust error handling to prevent game crashes. Add try-catch blocks for: image loading failures, localStorage access (for future high score feature), timer functions. Current code: [paste]. Where should error handling be added?"

23. Performance Testing:
    Prompt: "What are potential performance bottlenecks in this code? [paste]. Look for: excessive DOM manipulation, memory leaks from intervals/timeouts, redundant calculations. Suggest optimizations."

POLISH AND FINAL TOUCHES:
